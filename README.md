## Project Overview

This interactive dashboard analyzes bike-sharing data, providing insights into user behavior and trends. The goal is to explore patterns of bike usage, such as peak hours, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics. The dashboard offers:

- Analysis of hourly, daily, and monthly bike usage trends.
- Insights into user types (e.g., casual vs. subscriber) and their behavior.
- Visualization of the most popular start and end stations.
- Examination of trip durations and how they vary across different times of day.
- Weather data integration to understand how conditions affect bike usage.

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit. It serves as a practical example for analyzing and visualizing bike-sharing data.

## How to Run the Dashboard

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bike-sharing-dashboard.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd bike-sharing-dashboard
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run bike_sharing_dashboard.py
   ```

The dashboard will open in your web browser, providing an interactive analysis of the bike-sharing data.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains trip data from a bike-sharing system, including information such as start and end times, station locations, trip durations, and user types. You can find the data files in the `data` directory of this repository.
